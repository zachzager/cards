# Deck of Cards Workout Web Application

### Summary
This is simple web application replicates the functionality of a deck of cards used for a randomized work out. It is lightweight, making it ideal for screen sharing as part of a group work out.

You are invited to use this application for whatever use case you would like. We would love to hear your ideas. However, it was implemented with a specific set of rules in mind. These are summarized below.

### Suggested Rules
The value of each card represents the number of repetitions of each exercise. Any value below five rounds up. Jokers are modifiers that increase the number of reps to complete. The creators of this application typically use the following mnemonic mapping for each card:

 - Spades ♠: Squats
 - Clubs ♣: Calf Raises
 - Diamonds ♦: Dips or a rotating arm exercise (e.g., curls and shoulder press)
 - Hearts ♥: 

### How to Use
Complete the number of reps shown for the relevant exercise. Press the "Next Card" button to continue. Press the "Restart" button after completing for another round if you have the strength. We typically finish each section with an additional abs work out.
